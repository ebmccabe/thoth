<p>The <b>TH</b>reat intelligence <b>O</b>perators <b>T</b>actical <b>H</b>ost (<b>THOTH</b>) 
originally started as a pet project in the fall of 2014 to address a gap within the 
threat intelligence community.  A <i>dedicated</i> distribution and functional platform 
that allows analysts to focus their efforts on analysis instead of configuring tools.</p>

<p>The goal of project THOTH is to provide a stable, production ready distribution
for threat intelligence analysts with a number of relevant applications already 
installed and configured.  </p>

<p>The THOTH platform was designed based on commodity hardware specifications with
applications aligned with the logical progression of the core threat intelligence 
processes:</p>
<ol>
<li> Collection </li>
<li> Processing </li>
<li> Analysis </li>
</ol>

<p>Using a light weight desktop, a combination of public and open
source tools, feeds and information the applications are logically grouped into
their respective process areas, following the natural flow around the technical 
aspects of threat intelligence efforts.</p>

<p>The THOTH platform serves as the cornerstone of Rendition InfoSec's Threat 
Intellgience Training program and is currently being employed by a variety of
public and private organizations as part of their threat intelligence programs.</p>

<!-- <p>The THOTH project is an indirect fork of the DAVIX 2014 project 
(https://github.com/secviz/davix) which @edwardmccabe had the opportunity 
to be a part of with @raffaelmarty. </p> -->
